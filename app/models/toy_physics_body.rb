# To create the physics body from a toy I am going to generate the convex hulls of each part,
# except for circles which are separate.
# If the convex hull of one part is completely inside the convex hull of another part it is
# ignored. NOT YET.
# Any line segments "close" to each other should be regarded as connected -- paths. NOT YET.
# A single separate line segment is expanded to a "thin" rectangle -- lines.
# A single separate point is treated as a circle (but without the ability to rotate) -- dots.

# UNFORTUNATELY it appears that each physics body has to be associated with a node.
# This means that I will either have to create some invisible nodes or else just one
# physics body which encloses all relevant parts. But the body must be convex.
